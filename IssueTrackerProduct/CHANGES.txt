    redirect you to the correct new issue URL.

    New feature: Issues are now movable in the ZMI. (Real#0030)

    subscribed to.
    
    New feature: Issues and threads are now indexed in the ZCatalog

    when searching for issues. It's faster and more advanced.
    (Press the Update Everything button to activate it)    
    
    New feature: Using a search term which is a section, status, type,
    urgency, fromname or email will make a special filter-link appear

    compacter list. See bottom of ListIssues page.

    class. This caused problems with its attributes and methods.

    Bug fixed: If 'slimmer' is installed, the Management, Properties and
    POP3 tabs would turn black. This happened because 
    TemplateAdder.py had a bug where the 'optimize' parameter was

    New feature: When logged in (standard ACL User or IssueTrackerUser) you
    now get a page with all your related issues and followups. 

    New feature: An internal counter keeps track of what numerical increment
    to use when generating the next Id for an issue or a follow up. 
    This works like sequences in PostgreSQL and prevents reappearing URLs
    when issues have been deleted.

    New feature: title tag now reflects what page you're on.

    Bug fixed: JPEG file attachments uploaded when using Internet Explorer used
    a non-standard content-type. (Thanks Melvin Jacobson)

    New feature: Much improved information page about StructuredText with
    simple quick examples.

    New feature: Temporarily uploaded file attachments are now stored inside
    the issue tracker instance instead of the global /temp_folder which should
    do away with some low level persistency errors in Zope2.7.x.

    that deploys standards, updates the ZCatalog, assures all objects have
    the correct attributes and clears temporary uploaded file attachments.

    managers only. Now they are.

    now not appear anymore.

    couple of words from the issue description.

    automatically create a Vocabulary. Added that to InitZCatalog().

    New feature: Improved the use of Recent history so the page templates
    will now show them without having to create a Batch object. This will
    decrease rendering time.

    New feature: If you search an click a found issue, '?=' is not passed
    in the URL but still works the same. More convenient for copy-and-paste
    URLs without the search argument.

    New feature: All templates are now interfaced as CheckoutableTemplates
    (see http://zope.org/Members/peterbe/CheckoutableTemplates)
    This means that any IssueTrackerProduct instance's templates can easily
    be customized without having to change any sourcecode and makes it
    possible to install upgrades.

    New feature: Almost all occurances of absolute URLs in the generated
    HTML has been replaced by relative ones. This makes the resulting  
    HTML slightly smaller in size.

    New feature: ListIssues and CompleteList is now much faster
    if you are not doing a search. It was before doing a search on 
    nothing instead of using objectValues(). Great speed improvement.    

    New feature: POP3Account now has a configurable port number.

    Bug fixed: POP3 was not working in Zope270 due to a bad class import.

- 0.5.2

    is stored so that if you loose your cookie but log in the same the
    fromname and email is still there.

    when expecting list, now it returns [] in this case. Affected POP3.

    "5 Latest Issues".

    Bug fixed: Sometimes the "Notify the others" on followup showed 
    incorrect results.

    New feature: List Issues now shows what last happened in every 
    issue.

    New feature: "5 Latest Issues" shows who posted the last followup.

    New feature: If the submitter is in Always notify, he is not getting
    the Always notify email.  

- 0.5.1

    Bug fixed: AddIssue and QuickAddIssue wasn't properly implemented
    with the ClassSecurityInfo() which would cause a "unauthorized"
    error without login prompt if a parent object has the View 
    permission switched off.

    Bug fixed: The accesskeys previously implemented didn't work 
    properly in Internet Explorer so I took it off until I know 
    more about adding accesskeys.

    New feature: Accesskeys to the main tabs. Try for example: ALT + h

    New feature: There is now a 'Show Always notify status' option
    if you want to display which Always notify that have been notified.
    Very useful to the "issue adder" if uncertain who gets to know 
    about the added issue. Default is off. See Advanced properties.

    New feature: If you call rss.xml?show=all then it also shows
    threads/follow ups are items with "Followup to:" added to the 
    title of the issue.
    
    Bug fixed: rss.xml did not sort on 'issuedate' but on default
    sortorder which could become confusing.

    Bug fixed: When using your own statuses and the first one is not
    'open', you would get an error when trying to add an issue when
    not running as manager.

    Bug fixed: When creating an issuetracker instance and using the
    Properties Wizard some default boolean values were incorrectly
    saved.

    Bug fixed: Creation of emails was buggy because of spelling 
    misstake. It read '\r\b' when it should have been '\r\n'.

    Bug fixed: Dodgy emails wheren't ignored properly. Now they are.
    
    Bug fixed: "(mail@peterbe.com) bla bla" was converted to:
    "<a href="mailto:(mail@peterbe.com)">(mail@peterbe.com)</a> bla bl"
    but now that is fixed.

- 0.5.0b

    New feature: When viewing an issue, the Add followup etc. buttons
    is only shown at the top. At the bottom is a minial version of 
    the Add Followup form.

    New feature: Now statuses are no longer hardcoded.
    See the Properties tab where each line is a state,action combo
    of statuses. Looking at the existing list it should be obvious
    how it works.

    New feature: Download button and the Confidential & Hide me 
    options are now by default hidden.
    
    New feature: JavaScript encoded email hyperlinks. Idea taken from
    http://www.zope.org/Members/jmeile/email%20encoder
    A new property has been introduced for this. See bottom of 
    Properties tab. This is **recommended** for public instances.

    New feature: A simple Statistics page. It's linked from the Home
    page if you're logged in as Manager or if you have switched of the
    Private Statistics property.

    New feature: Inbound emails now get a confirmation message sent
    back. This is optional and for it to work you need to redeploy
    standards to get the SendInboundEmailConfirm_script

    Bug fixed: Accepting email objects can not be created if the 
    email address is already used as an always-notify to prevent 
    notifications becoming inbound email.

    Bug fixed: Dodgy email attachments are now ignored thanks to an
    added try & except statement.
    
    New feature: When you upgrade the product some new properties
    might have been introduced but not instanciated for. Visit the
    Management tab and see the All properties header.

    New feature: Inbound email via POP3. You can now set up one or 
    more POP3 accounts each with one or more email addresses that are
    dedicated to sniff for emails sent to it that is converted to 
    issues. 
    It depends on the email package from http://mimelib.sourceforge.net/
    and if you want to strip HTML formatted emails you are advised to
    install Strip-o-Gram from http://www.zope.org/Members/chrisw/StripOGram
    For this to work you are expected to set up some sort of cron job
    to periodically check for new email.

    Bug fixed: Lines that start with a URL or an email address turned
    to e.g. c<a href="mailto:opyright@dot.com">opyright@dot.com</a>.

    works. Thank you Wolfgang Reinelt.

    Javascript error.

    Bug fixed: Improved getRoot() when using Virtual Hosts

    Properties tab as expected.

    Bug fixed: ShowIssueData and the 'change these attributes' action
    link was misspelled. Now fixed.

    Gave up on the ReportLab module. CompleteList will have to suffice
    for now.

    reindexes all objects.

    New feature: added showURL2Issue() which concatenates too
    long URLs in ShowIssueData.

    you there.

    Made emailstring cookies be per instance but fromname and email is across
    all instances.

    ...instead of...
    ListIssues?sortorder=sections&reverse=1&start=12

    Improved AddIssue, QuickAddIssue and AddFollowup so that it sets
    focus in the first field of the input first automatically.

    of their location in space.

    Minor improvements to the dispatcher.html object in standards.

    Fixed the tabs for IssueNotifications.
